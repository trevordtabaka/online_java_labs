Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?
It helps make your program flexible. You can re-use code more often.

2.) What is type erasure?
This is when at compile time all <E> will be replaced by the correct type such as <String>.

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?
ArrayList

4.) Can an interface be generic?
yes

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?
Bounded means that the generic type that is replaced must be replaced by a subclass of the given bound(s).
Unbounded means you can use any valid datatype for the generic aspects.
