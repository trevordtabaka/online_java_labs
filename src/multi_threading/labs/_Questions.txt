Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a thread and why do we use them?
It is where all code execution occurs. We use them to start programs and tasks inside programs in the background

2.) What are the two ways to create a thread?
Make a class that extends Thread or implements runnable

3.) How do you start a thread using the Runnable interface?
make a Thread variable and in the constructor you create the Thread object passing the "this" parameter',
then call the start() method from the newly created thread object

4.) How do you start a thread using the Thread class?
make a class that extends Thread. Create a constructor that calls the super constructor. Implement run() method in class.

Make an instance of this class in a main method for instance

5.) How do you change a thread priority?

By using the threadName.currentThread().setPriority(int 1-10)
